### Mechanics
#### Winning
The player wins when they defeat the boss.

#### Losing
- The player loses when they lose all 3 lives.
- They can lose a life if they get hit bit an enemy bullet, or get hit by the enemy itself, if they currently don't have any Follower powerups active. If they do have at least one follower it simply removes one of them and makes the player invulnerable for a little time.
- The player loses a life instantly when they collide with the boss whether they have a follower or not.

#### Scoring
The player adds score when they:
- Pick up a coin.
- Pick up a powerup.
- Defeats an enemy.
- Defeats the boss.

#### Drops and powerups
- The Coin drop adds to the score.
- The Bullet powerup adds another bullet to the player weapon that can be fired simultaneously as the previous ones they had. Player can fire up to 3 bullets simultaneously. They don't lose this powerups unless they die. There are 3 kinds of firing:
    - 1 small bullet
    - 2 small bullets
    - 2 small bullets and a bigger one on the middle
- The Follower powerup adds a little companion that follows the player around them and fires a small bullet whenever the player fires. Player can have up to 3 followers simultaneously. If they get hurt and they have at least one follower it removes one of them.

#### Enemies
##### Common enemies
- Type 1: The tiny one.
    - It shoots a tiny bullet from time to time and moves at middle speed from top to bottom of the screen, and left to right and viceversa. It has little health as well.

- Type 2: The fast one.
    - It flies at a high speed from top to bottom of the screen. It has a medium amount of health.

- Type 3: The heavy one.
    - It behaves like the tiny one but it moves slowly and has a lot more health. It fires a larger bullet from time to time.

##### The boss
It appears after certain time had passed and shoots different kind of bullets and bullet patterns. Patterns change every 8 seconds and fire during 6 seconds each.

- Pattern 1: Shoot forward.
    - It shoots some waves of random bullets forward at random between certain angles.

- Pattern 2: Shoot circle.
    - It shoots a circle of bullets around it several times, alternating between 2 amount of total bullets.

- Pattern 3: Shoot star.
    - Like the circle on but with sort of like a star or flower pattern. Alternates between a 5 point star and a 6 point star pattern.

- Pattern 4 and 5: Shoot spiral and shoot spiral reverse.
    - It shoots a spiral of bullets that spins either clockwise ot counter-clockwise.

##### Enemy bullets
There are 4 kinds of enemy bullets that differ in size, shape and speed. Their speed increments as time passes.

#### Player
The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrows or the WASD keys.  
They can fire once by pressing the space bar or keep firing constantly by holding it down.

##### Player bullets
There are 2 kinds of bullets that differ in size, shape and damage that the player can fire, and 1 type of bullet that the follower companions can shoot that is smaller and damages less.

##### Follower companions
They rotate around the player and fire a small bullet whenever the player fires.  
If the player gets hurt, one of them dissapears.

### Complexity
- Space 50 is a game that takes bits of every other game we've seen in the course but it adds some other functionality as well.
- It also translates some of the mechanics seen in LOVE2D to the Unity engine.
- It starts like the Helicopter Game in its core with the scrolling background and the player that collides with objects and adds to score. But it is translated into 2D.
- The background uses parallax scrolling with 3 layers.
- There are more types of enemies with different behaviours each.
- There is also the boss at the end of the level that adds a definitive way of winning the game.
- There are coins like in Helicopter Game but there are also 2 different powerups with different consequences for the player like in Mario game, either adding another bullet or a follower companion that follows the player and also shoots a bullet.
- Enemy's movement speed, health and their bullet's speed increments as time passes.
- There is also the shooting system that reminds of the Zelda game pot throwing.
- It uses the same scenes as the Dreadhalls game with the addition of the YouWonScene where it congratulates the player for winning and lets them play again. 
- It procedurally generates enemy waves like the pipes in the Flappy Bird game but there are more types of enemies and quantities. It has a pause menu as well.
